desSLM = LCoS-SLM is a SLM can modulate both amplitude and phase of light, Its internal structure is similar to regular LCD display, is a matrix structure composed by many grid pixel. When voltage is applied to each pixel the liquid crystal will rotate to different angle along with different voltage which will create different refractive index to achieve modulation. In the case of the SLM is not given the signal SLM\u2019s basic structure will affect  the optical performance, including maximum diffraction angle of the diffraction efficiency, and the change of polarization state, by using these characteristics we are able to calculate the basic parameters of the SLM, such as : pixel size, the aperture ratio, and the rubbing angle.
desAmplitude = A spatial light modulator (SLM) along with the angle adjustment of polarizer and analyzer can make the spatial light modulator becomes the amplitude modulator or phase modulator, from the previously calculation of the spatial light modulator transmittance we can know that there will be maximum amplitude transmittance while the polarizer and the alignment layer on the same direction (\u03b2 = 0), We will utilize this characteristic to find out the LC director of the spatial light modulator.\nAfter we identify the LC director of SLM then we use polarizer 45 degrees between LC director and 90 degrees between analyzer setting to obtain transmittance vary in Sinusoidal format which caused different gray scales then add in a lens ,designed Object distance, image distance and magnification by the lens maker formula in the back to create a simple projection system .
desPhaseModulation = In last chapter we adjusted polarizer and analyzer so that make SLM become an amplitude modulator and with lens to form a simple a projection system. In this chapter we will again adjust polarizer and analyzer to achieve a phase modulator when polarizer, analyzer and LC director are on the same direction we will get the maximum penetration T = 1, is also representative said that no matter how the liquid crystal molecules are transferred will not affect the intensity of the light emitted, but it will cause phase difference.
desMichelson = Interference phenomenon is generated by the two or more than two waves superposed on the space. By the phase difference caused by the optical path difference arising bright lines (constructive interference) and the Obscure (destructive interference) and other interference. To observe the interference in addition to the above-mentioned phase needs caused by constructive interference and destructive interference, also need to pay attention to the direction of light polarization and coherence. In a simple way, the two polarized waves have the same optical path difference reaches closer to the screen and then the interference will have better contrast
desDiffaction = Volatile nature of light can be easily observed from the interference and diffraction phenomena we have to start from Huygens-Fresnel principle to explain the that, every point on the wave front can be regarded as a new point wave source each issues secondary spherical waves, the new position of the wavefront is on the envelope surface of spherical. Therefore as shown as graph below a single slit diffraction when the plane wave pass through the slit then every point on the slit as a new point source of light radiate light wave on every direction , A part of the non-diffracted light straight ahead in the distance to reach the same phase to form a light spot on the screen. There are other light beams with angle \u03b8 of the horizon travel in the direction when the top beam and the lower beam with exactly one wavelength optical path difference then the center beam will be half wavelength away from the top beam (phase difference \u03c0) and be neutralized .So the whole beam  will have half wavelength difference and be neutralized finally will display dark fringe on the screen.\nYoung's double-slit experiment is a wavefront splitted interferometer original wavefront is blocked by 2 slits and leave only  the parts through the slit, The light through slits consider as a new point wave source form a interference on the distant screen. When the incident light with angle \u03c6 of horizon and optical path difference is one wavelength, that two beams form the constructive interference and finally form a bright fringe in the distance of the screen.
desSpectrometer = Spectrometer is widely used to analyze optical properties of various materials, which is due to the spectrometer can analyze spectral and measure intensity distribution of each wavelength. The principle is to use different frequencies of light have different angles of diffraction with the same grating periodicity. Assume the grating period is d, the wavelength is \u03bb and the diffraction angle is \u03b8, when the relationship between the wavelength with periodic grating as below dsin\u03b8m=m\u03bb \nWhere m is the diffraction order, at this time there is diffraction light on the direction of original light path with angle \u03b8m along with different wavelength will cause different diffraction angle. Result as below graph. Detection of light incident on the grating in a periodic grating affected by different wavelengths of light diffracted into different directions, so the red will have  larger angle due to the longer wavelength and the blue due to the shorter wavelength so will have a closer angle  to the original reflective route then by using lens to focus the different wavelengths of light on the focal plane, and measure position and angle of each band to calculate the wavelength.
desSignalProcessing = 4-f optical system is the input data U (x, y) is placed at the front focal plane of the first lens and generate spectrum on the back  focal plane, then after filtering, and then do Fourier transform again by the second lens finally generated graphics filtered. we can observe the graphic on the back focal plane of the first lens, to achieve filtering we only have to block the frequency we don\u2019t want on this spectrum plane, block high frequency, low frequency, the frequency of the x-direction and the frequency of the y-direction which will result different variations on the final imaging surface.
desPhaseRetarder = Phase-shift digital holography use object light and three to four different set of initial phase of the reference light interference fringes, calculated the original wave amplitude and the phase that general optical instruments cannot detected. By using 4 or 3 set of interference fringes we can obtain complete information of the original object wave. Then we will be able to use this complete physical wave information accompany with Fresnel Diffraction to calculate back the shape of the original object.
desTalbot = The near-field diffraction theory of diffraction (Fresnel Diffraction) has a very complicated integral formula, the results of the general integral by square hole diffraction can also be seen to be quite large and complex, but the diffraction grating has a more cyclical simple self-imaging results and the special phenomenon.
desWavefront = SLM (Spatial Light Modulator) can receive electrical signals to change the light signal, which is to change the amplitude and phase of light wave. modulation of a good optical signal not only can cause a variety of different waves to generate an image but also allows SLM to simulate variety of simple waveform such as a spherical wave, a cylindrical wave, and the plane wave to propagate to various directions, and these waveforms are usually generated by a lens, cylindrical lens and mirror, it is possible to produce these waveforms represent SLM can be a tunable optical component.
